# Raptors-Website
Raptors Website was a team project I did for one of my courses. The purpose of the website is to allow visitors to learn a little about the Toronto Raptors. Visitors can learn about the Raptors' history, roster, season stats (2018/19 & 2019/20), management and jerseys for the 2020/21 season.

Files in the repository reflect my contribution to this project. I was responsible for doing the main home page, the entire merch section, parts of the FanZone section and landing pages for the Franchise, Stats and Management sections. I also created a mockup for the website (screenshots inside Raptors Website Layout folder).
